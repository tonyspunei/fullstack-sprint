# This is my 6-month plan

## 🔥 Phase 1: Build Core Backend Muscles (Weeks 2–5)

### Objectives:

- Understand how full-stack web apps work end-to-end.
- Build REST + GraphQL APIs from scratch.
- Learn by doing, not reading.

### Tasks:

- [] Build 3 APIs in Node.js + Express (Auth, CRUD, Payments).
- [] Build 1 API in Django Rest Framework.
- [] Use PostgreSQL and MongoDB (separate projects).
- [] Containerize one project with Docker.
- [] Deploy to GCP or Linode VM.

### Outcome Projects:

- `project-auth-api`
- `project-blog-cms`
- `project-ecommerce-core`

## 🧠 Phase 2: CS and Systems Foundation (Weeks 3–9, in parallel)

### Objective:

**Content (Study 6–8 hours/week):**

- 📘 Grokking the System Design Interview (finish in 3 weeks)
- 📘 Grokking Algorithms or Python Algorithms (DSA basics)
- 🛠 Rebuild a basic URL shortener, file uploader, and notification system

### Outcome:

**I should be able to:**

- Design scalable systems on a whiteboard
- Talk about caching, queuing, load balancing, and DB tradeoffs
- Sketch system components using sequence diagrams

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Tooling & Ops Mastery (Weeks 6–10)

**Objective:**

Senior engineers own delivery and deployment. No more throwing code over the wall.

**Tasks:**
- Learn and implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Learn Docker + Docker Compose deeply
- Learn GCP basics: App Engine, Cloud Run, Firebase, Storage
- Deploy at least 2 full-stack apps using infrastructure as code (Terraform optional)

**Resources:**

- YouTube: TechWorld with Nana (Docker + DevOps)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions course (freeCodeCamp or Udemy)

**Deliverables:**

- A devops-toolbox repo with templates for pipelines, Dockerfiles, deploy scripts

## 🧪 Phase 4: Own a Signature Full-Stack App (Weeks 8–12)

**Objective:**

Create a flagship project that proves I'm senior-level.

**Ideas (Choose 1):**

- Freelancer CRM with Stripe/PayPal
- Real-time AI Generated Music App with Redis + WebSockets
- DevTools App (e.g. API Request Bin or Form Builder)

**Requirements:**

- Tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- CI/CD
- Auth + RBAC
- Role-specific dashboard
- Custom UI (no Tailwind-only clones)

**Deliverables:**

- Live URL
- GitHub repo with clean README
- Loom video walking through architecture

## 🏆 Phase 5: Prove It & Lead (Weeks 10–24)

**Objectives:**

- Contribute meaningfully to a real team codebase
- Get assigned the hard stuff
- Start making architecture decisions
- Get my promotion

**Strategies:**

- Start initiating refactors and tech debt fixes
- Lead sprint planning or estimation sessions
- Volunteer to onboard others, review PRs
- Write internal docs, RFCs, or architecture diagrams

**Stretch Goals:**

- Open-source contribution (bug fix or feature)
- Technical writing (1–2 blog posts)
- Ask my manager for a mid-review at Week 16, with a plan to hit Senior at Week 24
